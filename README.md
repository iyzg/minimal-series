# Minimal Notebooks

Work in progress of creating a set of notebooks that take you from Andrej Karpathy's [Micrograd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0) to understanding and being able to write a bunch of other machine and reinforcement learning concepts.

I'm aiming for these to be the *simplest* and *cleanest* implementations possible while still being good learning resources.

## Notebooks

- [Multilayer Perceptron](notebooks/minimal_mlp.ipynb)

## Roadmap

- Create tree of notebooks to progress through
- Style guide for diagrams?
- Grand list of what each notebook should teach
- List of future notebooks
- Make notebooks on concepts tangential but not exactly just models (ex. entropy -> KL-divergence)
